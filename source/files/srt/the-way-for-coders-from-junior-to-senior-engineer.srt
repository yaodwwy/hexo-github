00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:01,152
Hello everyone, I am Adam.

2
00:00:01,152 --> 00:00:05,184
This topic is the way for programmers from junior to senior engineer

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,808
Lets talk about the 10 stages of career promotion

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,200
if you are a new beginner, I hope to help you. Now follow me!

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,152
No matter which IDE you are using, you must learn to use hot keys

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,904
Yes, On the one hand is to pretend to bring you pleasure.

7
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,350
On the other hand is to save time. You are a coder be professional.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,640
Don't click the mouse poke around.

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,888
If it is Linux VIM or NANO full of keyboard operation, it is not so neat

10
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:33,536
Basically 'copy and paste delete and undo exit and save'

11
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:36,928
If you have learnt 'Operation by Line, Find and Replace', you will be better

12
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:41,000
For more operations, please refer to the pdf file at the bottom of the video

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Hotkey Guide.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,912
As the saying goes, workers must first sharpen their tools to do their best

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
A wrench is good for an engineer whole life

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,760
The same is true for software engineers

17
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,152
From development tool IDE to make your own tool

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,096
It takes a lot of time to save the toolbox
Juniors must at least know the common tool

19
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:03,680
There is also a lot of content about tools.
Chat later in the future

20
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:04,768
In the Java world

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,880
Google's Guava core library

22
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,416
Apache's Commons component

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,080
Spring's Utils framework

24
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,664
These tools can save a lot of cumbersome operations

25
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:17,952
For example, Guava's collection tool package

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,600
StringUtils Can solve the problem of string operation in the development process

27
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,288
BeanUtils Can quickly make entity copies

28
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,376
what? Never heard of it?

29
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,360
Colleagues need to change another welcome when they say hello tomorrow

30
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,768
Hi Bro! long time no see! Writing bugs aha?

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,529
Distributed version control system

32
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:36,857
Strictly It's not just a code management software

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,264
It is an idea A file backup idea

34
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:42,144
Let's revisit this from the example of protecting eggs

35
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:46,304
If you have a basket of eggs

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,096
How do you protect and eat it within the shelf life What issues do you need to care?

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
Is the basket strong and durable? If the basket is being broken What can I do?

38
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:53,088
Whether to carry the basket? Eat eggs at noon or at work at night?

39
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:56,544
Do I need to number the eggs?

40
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,050
If I take the eggs in the wrong order and eat them?

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,175
Do I need a camera on the basket to catch the eggs change?

42
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:01,879
......

43
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,968
May not take into account so many problems in life

44
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,976
But in the programing world Everything is data

45
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,256
Missing is missing

46
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:11,520
Do you remember your earliest camera phone,where are the photos you took？

47
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,080
Important information must be very careful:

48
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,344
Automatic multiple backup and Get it anytime, anywhere

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592
Git, An automatic backup history、Collaboration and distribution、Anywhere、Code management software

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Linus took it from his toolbox

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
The network drive you are using like Baidu Disk Google Disk OneDrive

52
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,744
Just like Git

53
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:35,456
The purpose is to manage your files (code)

54
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,592
Ensure that the usability, security, and coordination of files (code) are balanced in emergencies.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,632
The earliest programming was procedural oriented programming

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,488
Later There was no hierarchical classification.
The Object Oriented Programming concept was popular.

57
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:50,816
I also pondered this concept for several days when I was junior.

58
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:54,272
I found out that procedural just want to tell you how to treat it the same way

59
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,808
Put things together

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,896
The purpose is to reuse and classify.

61
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,200
Later, JS moved from the front end to the back end.

62
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,784
The anonymous method and function closures popular again.

63
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,896
However,Thought is object-oriented and behavior is as process-oriented as possible

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Don’t expose what can be hidden.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Life is short. Use closures.

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,624
Since I used SVN, I'm not afraid of jobs was too mach.

67
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:17,056
Since I use Git, I do not keep the garbage code anymore.

68
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,040
Be sure to delete the garbage code you commented out

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
Because you don't know the reason for commenting it after 30 days.

70
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:25,312
Once I pushed git, I deleted the deprecated code boldly.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,744
My code submission contribution in the team

72
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,624
Deleted code were more than added code.

73
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:33,888
As an excellent coder

74
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,128
At work the skill requirements are not absolute

75
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:38,240
but Logic.

76
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,736
10-minute code may take 3 hours to debug.

77
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,064
Debugging is not just trial errors.
It is more about clarifying the ins and outs.

78
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,624
Remember that there are no bugs for no reason.

79
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,056
The technology field needs to be logically clear.

80
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,784
The business field needs this thing more.

81
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Why do you want to do this business?
Why do you want to achieve this business?

82
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:55,840
You must ask more in your heart, Why?

83
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,128
Remember the tool classes mentioned above.

84
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,048
The tool classes were standard demonstration model for programmers.

85
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,968
From the junior to the senior

86
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:07,296
That is the process which from using other people's tools to developing tools.

87
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,664
做程序和做Just like a carpenter.

88
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:12,160
You can make the ergonomic business code your own.

89
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,232
Business code implementation must do everything possible to be pure

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,472
A pure component should solve a small problem.

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,904
The laziness here is not to let us do less work

92
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:21,632
Divide the work finer and finer

93
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,576
Become a code commander Lie down and finish your work

94
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,992
How to distinguish between programmers.

95
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:31,360
Plaid shirt jeans Black frame glasses backpack.

96
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,664
Of course, I won’t teach you how to beautify yourself.

97
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,456
Just to express the importance of OCD.

98
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,248
Tab replaces four spaces!

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,104
Never wrap the left curly bracket! !

100
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,896
The comments must be aligned with the code! ! !

101
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,136
Be sure to leave a line blank after a period of business processing! ! ! !

102
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:46,464
When you agree with me

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
As a senior coder, you must read the following tips
Learn to be generous and permit junior's mistakes

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,975
I have also followed the git commit record of teammates

105
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,560
I have also Silently open the code of the teammate and then close it

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,680
I have also optimized the writing method, revised the format and then rollback

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,496
Finally relieved, give up optimizing others' code

108
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:09,696
People have different tastes

109
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,808
Don't be too demanding on your teammates

110
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,280
let the junior make bold mistakes

111
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:17,120
and be happy with the junior

112
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:20,640
Be sure to allow elementary mistakes, premature optimization is the source of all evil

113
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,864
当你处在关键岗位上时

114
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,050
大大小小的会议是跑不掉了

115
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,225
morning meeting Evening meeting Summary meeting

116
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,533
Training meeting Demand meeting Technical seminar meeting

117
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,005
Demonstration meeting Docking meeting Demand communication meeting

118
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,850
At first you will feel that these meetings waste a lot of your working time

119
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,975
When you slowly realize it, you will find that this is the beginning

120
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,570
of your entry into the management post

121
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,750
Meetings can get you into business

122
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,375
Suddenly realized that he was a good product manager

123
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,423
At the same time, prepare a nice glass

124
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,199
It's better to put a little more water

125
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,351
Always forget to drink water when touching the keyboard

126
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,025
Take this opportunity to drink more water

127
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,344
In 1665, Newton went to the countryside to avoid the plague

128
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,100
Self-isolation No out-going No shopping

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,300
No party

130
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,350
He researched the principle of life and science

131
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,475
The COVID-19 Outbreak just gave us such an opportunity,

132
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,880
Being alone allows us to calm down and think more.

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,352
Don't just be a programmer

134
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,725
Do something important

135
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,069
Do something meaningful

136
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,541
Do something that solves the problem

137
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,421
You are the problem solver, creator, innovator

138
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,310
Not a programmer, programming is just a tool for you to complete innovation

139
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,278
To solve the actual problem

140
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:17,430
See you next time
